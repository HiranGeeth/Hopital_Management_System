### IoT Cloud Based Hospital Ward Resource Management System

As an Electrical & Electronics Engineering undergraduate, this project focuses on integrating existing bedside patient monitors into an IoT-based digital platform. Most ICU / ward monitors already have serial / RJ45 network communication ports capable of transmitting vitals data. Instead of replacing equipment, this system proposes an interface system which can extract SpO₂, BP, HR, Temperature etc. and buffer + upload data to a local server or cloud. This enables live streaming of vitals without requiring new capital hardware investment, making it cost-feasible for government hospitals.

On the software layer, a centralized ward dashboard displays all patient beds similar to an airport operations screen. Critical vitals auto-prioritize, highlight and shift to top for nurse response. A medication stock tracker is integrated to eliminate handwritten ward stock books and automate reorder logic. An alarm module allows nurses to schedule timed reminders (ex: injection deadlines) and these appear as visual alarms on the dashboard.

Future features include physician location tracking via RFID check-in and pharmacy integration for external medicine availability.

**Impact**: This system replaces manual book-based ward management in Sri Lanka with IoT-enabled, real-time decision support. It enhances patient safety, improves nursing responsiveness, optimizes drug stock control and builds the path toward smart hospital digitization.

**Relevant SDGs**: SDG 3 (Health), SDG 9 (Innovation), SDG 12 (Resource Efficiency).
